"""Indicates the _source_ of initial assets for a _new function_.  When using this query parameter, the request body does not need to contain assets, but any assets in the request body will overwrite the copied assets.  #### Selection of _assets_ source  * If set as `<sourceName>[@<sourceVersionRange>]`, the _new function_ will be created with copied assets of the selected _source function_. * If set as `!example`, a `runtime` query parameter is required, and the _new function_ will be initialized with assets of the _runtime example_.  #### Selection of the _source function_  When `<sourceVersionRange>` is a range (or is not given), the latest _published_ version (in that range) is used.  If no _published_ version exists, the latest _draft_ is selected.  If no versions in the range exist, a `404` _Not Found_ error is returned.  #### The `name` of the _new function_  If a `name` is NOT specified (either as query parameter, or in an optional manifest asset in the request body), the `name` of the _new function_ will be that of the _source function_.  #### The `version` of the _new function_  When the _target_ and _source_ name are equal, the `version` query parameters is defaulted to `<sourceVersionRange>` (`~<sourceVersionRange>` when it's an exact version)  The version of the _new function_ will be: * If a `version` is NOT specified (either as query parameter, in an optional manifest asset, or as `<sourceVersionRange>` _default_)    * a **patch increment** (`<major>.<minor>.<patch>+1`) of the latest **existing version** with the target `name`    * **`1.0.0`** otherwise  * If a `version` is specified:    * the **lowest version** in that range **if no existing version** is in that range.    * an **increment** of the latest existing version, **at the highest level** (_major_,_minor_,_patch_) allowed by that range.    * otherwise, if all allowed versions already exist, a **`409` _Duplicate_ error** is raised.  #### Deployment overrides  The new function will use the deployment overrides of the copied function, unless a _manifest_ was specified in the request body.."""
